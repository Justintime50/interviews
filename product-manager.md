# Product Manager Interviews

Product managers own the product strategy and deliverables of a company. It's their job to know what is most important, what project should be worked on and in what order, and what the product should look like. They often meet with customers to define "user stories" which Software Engineers or others then take and build out based on the criteria defined.
