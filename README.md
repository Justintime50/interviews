I've conducted hundreds of interviews and read thousands of resumes over my career. This repo contains all of my learnings, interview questions, and things to know when conducting technical (and other) interviews.

## General

### Things to Avoid

#### Illegal Questions

The following topics are illegal to ask about and must be avoided:

- Age or genetic info
- Birthplace, country of origin, or citizenship
- Disabilities
- Gender, sex, or sexual orientation
- Marital status, family, or pregnancy
- Race, color, or ethnicity
- Religion
- Salary history (instead, you can ask what salary range they are expecting for this new role)

## Role Interviews

Different roles require different questions. The following are role specific interview questions:

- [Product Manager](product-manager.md)
- [Software Engineer](software-engineer.md)
